# mouseNow
Allows the user to view the X/Y position of their mouse, rgb value, monitor resolution with DPI awareness and be able to copy them to their clipboard all with native Python modules that can be run in the command prompt. *Currently limited to only Windows Operating Systems*

**Instructions:**
  Drop mouseNow.py in a command prompt and hit enter, the script captures mouse updates with windows dll's and the msvcrt module for keypresses.
  Once you are satisfied with the location/color your mouse is hovering over you may copy it to your clipboard with the F2 and F3 keys, respectively.

*I have not tested this with multiple monitors yet so I'm not sure how it will react.*
